# Rock Paper Scissors

In the file RPS.py you are provided with a function called player. The function takes an argument that is a string describing the last move of the opponent ("R", "P", or "S"). The function should return a string representing the next move for it to play ("R", "P", or "S"). A player function will receive an empty string as an argument for the first game in a match since there is no previous play.
